## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Development Workflow
1. Code changes pushed to `develop` branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers development deployment
3. Terraform validates and applies changes
4. Automated testing and validation
5. Development environment updated

### Production Workflow  
1. Code merged to `main` branch
2. Security scanning and validation
3. Manual approval required for production
4. Terraform plan reviewed and approved
5. Production deployment with rollback capability

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based admin authentication
- AWS Secrets Manager for credential storage
- Secure password hashing (SHA-256)
- CORS configuration for web security

### Infrastructure Security
- VPC with private subnets for database
- Security groups with minimal access
- Encrypted storage (S3 and RDS)
- IAM roles with least privilege principle

### Data Protection
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Database backups with encryption
- Secure file upload validation
- Input sanitization and validation

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### CloudWatch Integration
- Lambda function metrics and logs
- RDS performance monitoring
- S3 access logging
- API Gateway request/response logs

### Alerting
- SNS notifications for critical events
- Database connection monitoring
- Lambda error rate tracking
- Cost monitoring and alerts

## 🛠️ Development Practices

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive documentation
- Error handling throughout
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Input validation and sanitization

### Testing Strategy
- Infrastructure validation with Terraform
- API endpoint testing
- Frontend accessibility testing
- Security scanning with Checkov

### DevOps Best Practices
- Infrastructure as Code
- GitOps workflow
- Environment parity
- Automated deployments
- Configuration management

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture
- Serverless functions scale automatically
- Database configured for development/testing workloads
- S3 provides unlimited storage scalability
- API Gateway handles traffic spikes

### Scaling Path
- Lambda concurrency limits monitoring
- RDS connection pooling optimization
- CloudFront CDN for global distribution
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### AWS Free Tier Alignment
- t3.micro RDS instance (750 hours/month free)
- Lambda within free tier limits (1M requests/month)
- S3 storage within free tier (5GB)
- API Gateway within free limits

### Cost Controls
- Resource tagging for cost tracking
- CloudWatch cost alerts
- Minimal resource allocation for development
- Automatic scaling prevents over-provisioning
